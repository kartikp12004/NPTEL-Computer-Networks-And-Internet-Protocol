1. How does the TCP Sliding Window mechanism contribute to efficient data transmission? 
a) By retransmitting all data upon detecting a single packet loss 
b) By dynamically adjusting the size of the transmission window 
c) By sending data in fixed-size packets regardless of network conditions 
d) By prioritizing specific data packets for faster delivery

Ans- B

2. What is a potential drawback of Nagle's algorithm? 
a) Increased error rate 
b) Increased latency for small packets 
c) Reduced bandwidth utilization 
d) Inefficient congestion control

Ans- B

3. Which mechanism is used to avoid Silly Window Syndrome at the receiver side? 
a) Delayed acknowledgment 
b) Nagle's algorithm 
c) Clark's solution 
d) Fast retransmit

Ans- C

4. What impact does a higher a value have on Jacobson's algorithm? 
a) It makes SRTT more sensitive to sudden RTT changes. 
b) It reduces the impact of new RTT measurements on SRTT. 
c) It increases the weight of RTTVAR in RTO calculation. 
d) It eliminates the need for RTTVAR.

Ans- A

5. When does TCP enter the Congestion Avoidance phase? 
a) When ssthresh (slow start threshold) is reached 
b) After three duplicate acknowledgments 
c) When the receiver's buffer is full 
d) After the congestion window is halved

Ans- A

6. If the Checksum field in the UDP header is set to 0, what does it indicate? 
a) The checksum is not computed. 
b) The checksum failed. 
c) The checksum is valid. 
d) The checksum is reserved for future use.

Ans- A

7. What is the purpose of the pseudo-header used in the UDP checksum calculation? 
a) To verify data integrity across multiple networks 
b) To include additional information like source and destination IPs 
c) To ensure compatibility with TCP 
d) To pad the UDP datagram to a fixed size

Ans- B

8. What does the listen() function do in socket programming? 
a) It binds a socket to an address. 
b) It puts the socket into a passive mode to wait for incoming connections. 
c) It actively connects to a server socket. 
d) It sends data over the socket.

Ans- B

9. Which function can be used to configure socket options like timeout or buffer size? 
a) setsockopt() 
b) sockopt() 
c) configure() 
d) options()

Ans- A

10. What is the advantage of an iterative server over a concurrent server? 
a) It is faster in handling multiple requests. 
b) It is easier to implement and debug. 
c) It supports asynchronous I/O. 
d) It has lower response times for high-traffic scenarios.

Ans- B
