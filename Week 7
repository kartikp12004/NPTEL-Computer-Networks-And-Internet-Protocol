1. Which of the following statements about delay components in a network is false? 
a) Propagation delay depends on the length of the transmission link. 
b) Queuing delay increases when incoming data exceeds the processing rate of a router. 
c) Transmission delay is influenced by the packet size and the bandwidth of the channel. 
d) Transmission delay is typically greater than queuing delay in congested networks.

Answer- D

2. How does traffic shaping differ from traffic policing in the context of QoS? 
a) Traffic shaping identifies and marks packets for prioritization, while traffic policing drops packets that violate QoS. 
b) Traffic shaping regulates outgoing traffic rates, while traffic policing monitors and drops packets violating QoS. 
c) Traffic shaping prioritizes real-time traffic, while traffic policing prioritizes non-real-time traffic. 
d) Traffic shaping is applied only at the router, while traffic policing is applied only at the source.

Answer- B

3. Which of the following statements about the token bucket algorithm are correct? 
S1: It allows burst traffic by using accumulated tokens. 
S2: It discards excess tokens when the bucket is full. 
S3: It smooths out traffic to a constant rate by dropping excess packets. 
S4: It allows traffic to exceed the token generation rate temporarily if tokens are available. 
a) S1 and S3 only 
b) S2 and S4 only 
c) S1, S2 and S4 only 
d) S2, S3 and S4 only

Answer- C

4. A video streaming service uses a token bucket with a token generation rate of 5 Mbps and a bucket size of 10 MB. If the stream has a sudden burst requiring 20 MB of data, how much data can be transmitted immediately without exceeding the allowed rate? 
a) 10 MB 
b) 15 MB. 
c) 20 MB 
d) 5 MB

Answer- A

5. During peak traffic, a network's RED mechanism begins dropping packets when the average queue size reaches the maximum threshold. Why is this early packet drop strategy crucial for maintaining QoS? 
a) It reduces packet loss for inelastic traffic by halting elastic traffic completely. 
b) It triggers congestion control in TCP before queue overflow occurs. 
c) It ensures low-priority traffic is always prioritized over high-priority traffic. 
d) It guarantees that all packets from elastic traffic are evenly distributed.

Answer- B

6. What is the primary role of a bandwidth broker in the DiffServ architecture? 
a) Assign DSCP values to packets dynamically. 
b) Reserve resources in all routers within a domain. 
c) Facilitate inter-domain QoS agreements. 
d) Manage traffic shaping at edge routers.

Answer- C

7. A company deploys IntServ for a critical application requiring guaranteed QoS. However, some flows experience denial of service due to resource unavailability. What mechanism in IntServ likely caused this issue? 
a) RSVP Policy Control 
b) Admission Control 
c) Priority Queuing 
d) Traffic Policing

Answer- B

8. A network router using Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) schedules packets from three classes with the following weights: 1, 2, and 3. If the total available bandwidth is 600 Mbps, how much bandwidth is allocated to the second class? 
a) 100 Mbps 
b) 200 Mbps 
c) 240 Mbps 
d) 300 Mbps

Answer- B

9. In a DiffServ domain, which of the following are responsibilities of the edge router? 
(i) Packet classification and marking based on DSCP. 
(ii) Queue management for congestion control. 
(iii) Policing to ensure compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs). 
(iv) Per-hop behavior (PHB) enforcement for forwarding packets. 
a) (i), (iii) only 
b) (i), (ii) only 
c) (ii), (iii) only 
d) (i), (iv) only

Answer- A

10. Which of the following parameters must be considered for admission control in QoS architectures to determine whether a new flow can be admitted? 
(i) Bandwidth availability on the network 
(ii) Delay tolerance of the existing flows 
(iii) Jitter requirements of the new flow 
(iv) Packet loss rate of the current network traffic 
a) (i), (ii) and (iii) 
b) (ii), (iii) and (iv) 
c) All are True 
d) All are False

Answer- C
